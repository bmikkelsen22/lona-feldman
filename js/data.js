      'S.W. is a small saltwater fish looking for a place to belong. In his travels, he sees many new places and fish along the way. He finds his home in Mexico, and best of all, friends that love him: a little family consisting of Mr. Dove, Red Cardinal, a stone "Lucky Duck"... along with a human being.'
